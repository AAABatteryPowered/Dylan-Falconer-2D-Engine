# Dylan Falconer 2D (but i attempted 3d) Engine
This originally started as following the 2d engine tutorial with C and SDL by Dylan Falconer, but I wanted to explore making a 3d game and I attempted to try and understand how to make it 3d from my code that currently only allowed 3d. I suceeded little in the fact i only made it look 3d once, and was a lot of trial and error and using functions with absurdly long names in an attempt to get something working. I watched hours worth of videos explaining how to build a 3d engine and how to do with with opengl, but most tutorials were c++ and glfw, I had to do so much digging to find obscure libraries that i had to fix errors in to get it somewhat working. This introduced me to the pain of C including setting up a working environment in VSCODE somehow, and also taught me things to do with memory and some c basics i hadn't encountered before
